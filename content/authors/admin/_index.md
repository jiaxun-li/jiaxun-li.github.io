I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Statistics Department at the University of Michigan advised by Ambuj Tewari. Before that, I studied Mathematics at Xi'an Jiaotong University and spent a year as a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I enjoy exploring diverse areas of statistics. In the past, I have worked on pandemic modeling and causal inference. My currect research interests lie in learning theory and its connections to modern statistical and machine learning problems.

Beyong academics, I like video games, photography, graphic design, movies and music.
